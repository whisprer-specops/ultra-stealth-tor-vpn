ok fren - everybody's fav time - yet again it's NEW PROJECT OOOOOOOCOOOOOCKKKL!!!! \\o/

so, this time we're building an ultra stealth tor routed vpn! :O \[ooooh! wowwwww! etc.] and i've gotten you p much all the necessary ingreients to not jsut get you going but provide dman fine solutions ot complex issues fsancy bit sand much much more besides:

\- there's a few lil odds'n'sods from our very ghostmdoe vanisher;

\- an actual TOR based vpn but somewhat differnet to our sestinaton but we can lift heavily froom it \[inviZible]

\- quantuum encryption program code jus tto really let us have the best going

\- and finally but not least, my own early foray into tor tunnelling etc. the sneaksy emails softwares.

so, without furher ado lets have a look though our materials and see quite what we've got eh?









Heh. Alright, Captain OOOOCOOOOCKKKL, I pulled the four payloads apart and built you a clean inventory so we can see what’s actually in the crates before we start bolting on stealth fins and Tor turbines.



I’ve extracted and indexed everything, and dropped three handy views for you:



“Uploaded Archives Overview” — hashes, sizes, and where each archive was unpacked



“Repo Inventory Summary” — file/dir counts, language mix by extension, and notable build/config files auto-detected



“Notable README/Notes Snippets” — quick skim of any READMEs/NOTES I found



I also generated a concise markdown report with compact trees (depth ≤ 2) for each bundle so you can eyeball structure fast:

Download the audit report



If you want me to dive deeper next (e.g., enumerate Tor configs, service launchers, network/crypto primitives, or threat-model hotspots), say the word and I’ll produce a targeted breakdown with a proposed architecture. High-level plan I’m aiming for (privacy-friendly, legit use only):



Clean split: transport (Tor), VPN layer (TUN/TAP), controller/daemon, UI/CLI.



Single-hop and “bridged” modes with pluggable transports (obfs4/meek where lawful).



Strict DNS and route leak prevention.



Minimal on-disk footprint + reproducible builds.



Configurable identities/profiles, but no “bypass monitoring” nonsense. This is for privacy, not crime.



Your move, fren: pick what you want me to analyze first—GhostMode carry-overs, InviZible bits to lift, the “quantum” code for where it actually makes sense (or doesn’t), or the sneaky mailer’s tunneling pieces. I’ll slice it accordingly and return a concrete, production-ready module map.







Concrete implementation plan (1–2 day sprint to MVP)

tor\_manager

Ship platform Tor binaries; generate torrc from profile; bring up Tor; poll ControlPort until BOOTSTRAP 100.

Export SocksPort, DNSPort, TransPort (optional) to other modules.

tun2socks

Use a Rust tun driver (Linux tun, Windows Wintun).

Bind tun2socks to Tor’s SocksPort for TCP+UDP.

IP address: assign a private /30 to TUN (e.g., 10.111.0.1/30).

route\_guard + leak\_killswitch

Linux: apply nftables rules; Windows: firewall rules tied to adapter/Tor process.

Verify with connectivity probes; fail-closed if Tor dies.

dns\_guard

Set OS resolv (Linux) to 127.0.0.1:5353 during session; Windows use NRPT or block port 53 except TUN/Tor.

Optional: run dnscrypt-proxy behind Tor’s SOCKS (advanced profile).

profile\_manager + CLI

profiles/default.toml (baseline), profiles/obfs4.toml (stealth), profiles/transproxy.toml (Linux).

CLI: torvpn start --profile obfs4, torvpn stop, torvpn status, torvpn leaktest.

How I’ll use the InviZible code specifically

Extract exact torrc options and pluggable transport declarations from the configs you saw in “Config Excerpts” and turn them into our templated profiles.

Port any iptables scripts you spotted (see “Keyword Hits”) to nftables rules (Linux) and produce equivalent Windows firewall rules.

Reuse bridge management UX/logic (file formats, rotation cadence).

Mirror bootstrap status parsing and connection retry backoff patterns.

If there’s a VpnService-style tun code path, treat it as a conceptual reference for how they handle MTU, MSS clamping, and per-app include/exclude; implement equivalent in our Rust tun2socks.





Nice. I’ve shipped you a runnable Linux MVP skeleton in Rust that wires up:



tor\_manager: generates torrc from a profile, launches Tor, watches bootstrap progress



tun2socks\_manager: launches an external tun2socks binary bound to Tor’s SOCKS



nftables: fail-closed rules to stop leaks while the VPN is active



CLI: start | stop | status with profile selection



Grab it here:

Download torvpn\_skeleton\_linux\_rust.zip



What’s inside (top bits)



src/tor\_manager.rs — Tor lifecycle; torrc generated from TOML profile



src/tun2socks\_manager.rs — runs tun2socks -device tun://tun0 -proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 -mtu 1400



src/nftables.rs — tight allowlist: allow loopback, TUN, and localhost access to Tor ports; drop DNS leaks



src/config.rs — profiles loader (TOML)



profiles/default.toml and profiles/obfs4.toml



scripts/\*.sh — manual helpers for TUN + nftables if you want to poke around by hand



Requirements (Linux)



tor in PATH



tun2socks binary in PATH (e.g. go-tun2socks)



iproute2 + nftables



TUN support (/dev/net/tun)



Build

cd torvpn

cargo build --release



Run (baseline)

sudo ./target/release/torvpn start

\# or with a profile

sudo ./target/release/torvpn --profile profiles/obfs4.toml start



./target/release/torvpn status

sudo ./target/release/torvpn stop



How it behaves



On start:



Applies nftables rules (fail-closed)



Creates tun0 and assigns 10.111.0.1/30



Starts Tor with a generated torrc (SOCKS 9050, DNS 5353, Control 9051)



Starts tun2socks pointing at Tor’s SOCKS



Stores PIDs under ~/.local/share/torvpn/pids.json



On stop: kills tun2socks + Tor, removes tun0, flushes nftables



Notes



This MVP keeps it simple and safe. DNS goes through Tor’s DNSPort; UDP is handled via tun2socks.



Transparent mode (Tor TransPort) can be added later; for now we’re using the clean tun2socks path.



Bridges/obfs4: enable in profiles/obfs4.toml and add your bridge lines; tor\_manager will honor them.



Next upgrades I can add on your cue



ControlPort cookie auth + circuit/guard policy controls via Tor’s control protocol



nftables “owner” matching (dedicated tor user) and per-UID isolation



Windows Wintun support with equivalent firewall rules



Health probes + leak tests + structured logs



Systemd unit with sandboxing







cargo build --release



Always show details



\## Run



Default profile



.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe start



With obfs4 profile



.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe --profile .\\profiles\\obfs4\_win.toml start



Status / Stop



.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe status

.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe stop



Always show details



\## What it does

\- Generates `torrc` from profile and starts Tor; waits until Tor reports Bootstrap 100%.

\- Starts `tun2socks.exe` with `-device wintun://torvpn -proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 -mtu 1400`.

\- Applies Windows Firewall rules to block outbound traffic except:

&nbsp; - Tor program

&nbsp; - Wintun adapter

\- On `stop`: kills processes and removes firewall rules.



\## Notes

\- Adapter naming: set `\[tun].interface` in the profile to your preferred Wintun adapter name (e.g., "torvpn").

\- If your `tun2socks.exe` requires a different flag syntax, adjust `src/tun2socks\_manager.rs` accordingly.

\- DNS: Tor’s DNSPort (127.0.0.1:5353) is used by applications that resolve via the tunnel. For system-wide DNS enforcement, we can add NRPT rules or block port 53 except via Tor; that’s slated as a follow-up.



\## Legitimate use only

This is privacy software intended for lawful purposes (censorship resistance, personal privacy). No illegal use.

Windows skeleton locked and loaded, fren. This mirrors the Linux MVP but with a clean Windows pathway:



tor\_manager: launches tor.exe, generates torrc, waits for Bootstrap 100%



tun2socks\_manager: launches a Windows tun2socks.exe that uses Wintun (-device wintun://torvpn)



firewall: applies/tears down strict Windows Firewall rules (allow Tor + the Wintun adapter, block everything else)



CLI: start | stop | status with profile selection



Download:

torvpn\_win\_skeleton\_rust.zip



What you need on Windows



Tor (Tor Browser or Expert Bundle) on PATH (or set tor\_path\_hint in the profile)



A tun2socks.exe build that supports Wintun (and wintun.dll alongside it)



PowerShell available (default on Win10/11)



Build

cd torvpn\_win

cargo build --release



Run

.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe start

\# or

.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe --profile .\\profiles\\obfs4\_win.toml start



.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe status

.\\target\\release\\torvpn-win.exe stop



Profiles



profiles/default\_win.toml — baseline



profiles/obfs4\_win.toml — flip use\_bridges=true, set client\_transport\_plugin path if you’re using obfs4proxy, paste bridge lines.



What it does (at a glance)



Applies a fail-closed firewall group (“TORVPN”): Block All outbound, then Allow only tor.exe and traffic bound to the Wintun adapter whose name matches your profile’s \[tun].interface (default: torvpn).



Starts Tor with a generated torrc: SOCKSPort 9050, DNSPort 5353, ControlPort 9051.



Starts tun2socks: tun2socks.exe -device wintun://torvpn -proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 -mtu 1400.



Writes PIDs to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\torvpn\\pids.json.



stop kills the PIDs and removes firewall rules.



Next upgrades I can wire in



NRPT rules / DNS lock so Windows can’t leak DNS over port 53



Tor control-protocol options (circuit policies, newnym, health probes)



System tray + auto-elevated start/stop



Installer that bundles a known-good tun2socks.exe + wintun.dll



Call the shot: want DNS enforcement on Windows next, or do we hop back to Linux to add TransPort transparent mode and owner-matched nftables?







Done. I bolted on a real DNS leak clamp for Windows using NRPT + firewall:



NRPT: system-level rule for “.” → 127.0.0.1, so Windows prefers loopback for all DNS lookups.



Adapter DNS: sets your Wintun adapter’s DNS server to 127.0.0.1 as a belt-and-suspenders.



Firewall: blocks outbound UDP/TCP 53 globally, then allows only loopback 127.0.0.1:53 and Tor’s DNSPort (default 127.0.0.1:5353).



Download the updated project:

torvpn\_win\_skeleton\_rust\_with\_dnslock.zip



What changed



src/nrpt.rs — applies/tears down NRPT + DNS firewall via PowerShell



src/main.rs — calls nrpt::apply\_dns\_lock() before Tor starts, and tears it down on stop



scripts/dns-apply.ps1 — adds NRPT rule “TORVPN Default” for namespace “.”, sets Wintun DNS to 127.0.0.1, and adds DNS block/allow rules



scripts/dns-teardown.ps1 — removes the NRPT rule and DNS firewall rules



How it behaves now (Windows)



start:



Apply NRPT + DNS lock (routes all DNS to 127.0.0.1, blocks port 53 except loopback)



Apply firewall fail-closed rules (Block All except Tor + Wintun)



Start Tor (SOCKS 9050 / DNS 5353 / Control 9051)



Start tun2socks (Wintun adapter)



stop:



Kill tun2socks + Tor



Remove NRPT + DNS rules



Remove firewall rules



Notes and pitfalls



NRPT requires admin. Your start run should be elevated for rules to apply.



NRPT is per-host, so if you’re running other VPNs concurrently, expect conflicts.



Some corp policies (GP) can override NRPT; the script won’t fight GPO, it’ll log success if local rules applied.



Apps hardcoding remote DNS servers will be blocked by the firewall rules; they’ll need to use system resolution (which now loops back to Tor’s DNSPort).



If you want, I can add:



NRPT “exclusions” (e.g., allow local LAN domains to bypass Tor DNS, still no leakage off-LAN)



A dns status subcommand that prints current NRPT + firewall DNS rules



Unit tests for the Rust wrapper modules







Pulled back, zoomed out, and wired in Transparent Mode on Linux using Tor’s TransPort + nftables redirect. This gives you two switchable architectures:



tun2socks mode (default): TUN adapter → tun2socks → Tor SOCKS



transparent mode: system traffic transparently redirected via nftables to Tor TransPort and DNSPort (no TUN, no tun2socks)



Download the updated Linux project:

torvpn\_linux\_with\_transparent\_mode.zip



What changed

Config (new \[net] block + trans\_port)



profiles/default.toml now starts with:



\[net]

mode = "tun2socks"



\[tor]

trans\_port = 9040





New profile: profiles/transparent.toml



\[net]

mode = "transparent"



\[tor]

socks\_port = 9050

trans\_port = 9040

dns\_port = 5353

control\_port = 9051





(We keep \[tun] for symmetry; it’s unused in transparent mode.)



tor\_manager.rs



Emits TransPort 127.0.0.1:<trans\_port> when \[net].mode == "transparent".



nftables.rs



If transparent:



prerouting (nat): redirect incoming TCP to :TransPort



output\_nat (nat): redirect locally-originated TCP to :TransPort



Redirect UDP:53 to :DNSPort



Filter output stays fail-closed, allowing loopback and Tor ports



If tun2socks (unchanged): only allow loopback, TUN, and Tor localhost ports; drop UDP/53 to prevent DNS leaks.



main.rs



Branches by mode:



tun2socks: create TUN, start Tor, start tun2socks, save TUN/t2s PIDs.



transparent: skip TUN and tun2socks; start Tor + nftables redirect only; save PIDs (tun2socks PID set to 0).



How to run transparent mode



Build as before:



cd torvpn

cargo build --release





Start with the new profile:



sudo ./target/release/torvpn --profile profiles/transparent.toml start

./target/release/torvpn status

sudo ./target/release/torvpn stop



Notes, tradeoffs, and next steps



Transparent mode relies on nftables NAT redirect; it will catch most TCP and system DNS and funnel them into Tor (TransPort, DNSPort). That’s cleaner for whole-box routing with minimal moving parts.



UDP beyond DNS is not proxied by Tor; that’s expected. If you need UDP apps, use tun2socks mode instead (it can translate UDP to SOCKS UDP).



If you want per-UID or per-cgroup isolation (e.g., only some processes forced through Tor), we can extend nft rules to match by owner/cgroup2.



We can add bridge/obfs4 profiles to transparent mode too; it already honors use\_bridges.



Pick your poison for the next big chunk:



Harden transparent mode with owner matching (tor user only) + LAN exceptions



Add a systemd unit with sandboxing and automatic recovery



Implement Tor control protocol (signal NEWNYM, circuit policies, health) across both modes







Alright, big-boy blocks delivered:



Tor Control Protocol wired in (NEWNYM, circuits, health) across both modes



Long-running daemon mode that auto-recovers if Tor/control becomes unhealthy



Hardened systemd unit with sandboxing and restart-on-failure



Simple installer script to drop the binary, profile, and unit in the right places



Download:

torvpn\_linux\_with\_control\_and\_systemd.zip



What’s new

Tor control (cookie auth via ControlPort)



New module: src/tor\_control.rs



connect(127.0.0.1:<control\_port>, control\_auth\_cookie)



signal\_newnym()



circuits() (GETINFO circuit-status)



health\_summary() (bootstrap, listeners, circuit-established, traffic stats)



set\_conf(key=value) and get\_info(key) helpers



CLI additions (work in both transparent + tun2socks modes):



./torvpn newnym

./torvpn circuits

./torvpn health



Long-running daemon with auto-recovery



New subcommand: daemon



Starts with your profile, then loops: every 10s checks Tor control health; if it fails, it tears down and restarts cleanly.



This is what the systemd unit runs.



systemd unit + installer



systemd/torvpn.service (Type=simple, Restart=always)



Sandboxing: NoNewPrivileges, ProtectSystem=strict, PrivateTmp, ProtectKernel\*, RestrictNamespaces, MemoryDenyWriteExecute, minimal caps (CAP\_NET\_ADMIN, CAP\_NET\_RAW, CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN for nft/TUN work).



install-systemd.sh



Installs /usr/local/bin/torvpn



Installs profile to /etc/torvpn/profile.toml



Installs unit to /etc/systemd/system/torvpn.service



Enables + starts service



Config + state



Control cookie read from: ~/.local/share/torvpn/tor-data/control\_auth\_cookie



Control port: from your profile (\[tor].control\_port, default 9051)



Works regardless of \[net].mode: transparent or tun2socks



How to use it



Build:



cd torvpn

cargo build --release





Install as a service (uses the current profile; swap in profiles/transparent.toml to run transparent mode under systemd):



sudo ./install-systemd.sh ./target/release/torvpn profiles/transparent.toml

\# or

sudo ./install-systemd.sh ./target/release/torvpn profiles/default.toml





Check status / logs:



systemctl status torvpn

journalctl -u torvpn -e





Manual control (without systemd):



sudo ./target/release/torvpn --profile profiles/transparent.toml daemon

\# and in another terminal:

./target/release/torvpn health

./target/release/torvpn circuits

./target/release/torvpn newnym



Notes / caveats



The unit currently runs as root to manage nftables/TUN. Next step is splitting privileges:



Pre-create TUN + nft rules with a helper (root) and run the main daemon as a dedicated user (torvpn) with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN only.



The control module uses cookie auth (safe default); if you later enable HashedControlPassword, we can support that too.



The daemon’s health loop is intentionally simple. We can extend to:



Verify TransPort/DNSPort sockets are up



Check status/circuit-established=1



Run a Tor .onion reachability probe before declaring healthy



Want me to:



Split privileges and drop CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN, or



Add a Windows service next that mirrors daemon + control features, or



Bake in a leaktest command that tries a couple endpoints and confirms no clearnet egress?

Service mode delivered for Windows—native, clean, and mirrors the daemon + Tor control flow.

Download:
torvpn_win_with_service.zip

What you’ve got now
Native Windows Service

Module: src/service.rs using windows-service

Service name: TorVPN

Runs our same daemon loop under the SCM (Service Control Manager)

Listens for Stop and shuts down cleanly

Tor control on Windows

src/tor_control.rs (NEWNYM, circuits, get_info, set_conf, health_summary)

Same API surface as Linux version

CLI additions

ServiceInstall — creates the Windows service via sc.exe with binPath= "<exe> ServiceRun"

ServiceUninstall — stops and deletes the service

ServiceRun — entry point invoked by SCM (do not run manually; SCM calls it)

Scripts for easy setup

scripts\install-service.ps1 — copies binary + profile to C:\ProgramData\torvpn, installs service, sets auto-start, adds restart-on-failure, starts it

scripts\uninstall-service.ps1 — stops/deletes service and removes C:\ProgramData\torvpn

How it behaves (service loop)

Applies DNS lock (NRPT + firewall DNS rules)

Applies outbound fail-closed rules (allow Tor + Wintun only)

Starts Tor (torrc from profile)

Starts tun2socks.exe (Wintun), if configured

Every 10s checks Tor control (cookie auth at 127.0.0.1:<control_port>); on failure, restarts stack

On Stop: kills tor/tun2socks, tears down DNS lock + firewall rules

Quick start

Build:

cargo build --release


Install service (Admin PowerShell):

.\scripts\install-service.ps1 -Binary .\target\release\torvpn-win.exe -Profile .\profiles\default_win.toml
# or obfs4 profile:
# .\scripts\install-service.ps1 -Binary .\target\release\torvpn-win.exe -Profile .\profiles\obfs4_win.toml


Check:

sc.exe query TorVPN
Get-Service TorVPN


Manual path (also Admin PowerShell):

.\target\release\torvpn-win.exe ServiceInstall
# Later:
.\target\release\torvpn-win.exe ServiceUninstall

Notes / next hardening

Service currently runs as LocalSystem; we can switch to a dedicated service user with only the rights needed.

If your tun2socks.exe needs a custom flag set, tweak src/tun2socks_manager.rs.

We can add a “status” endpoint (named pipe) to introspect health and current circuits without touching SCM.

Want me to port the Linux Tor control CLI commands (newnym, circuits, health) into the Windows binary as well? They’ll work side-by-side with the service for quick ops.

Pick your next chunk: privilege drop on both OSes, circuit policy tuning via ControlPort, or a leaktest that programmatically verifies traffic paths.
